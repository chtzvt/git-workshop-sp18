Hello! My name is Jose R. Cancel Velez.
This has been a great experience, definitely gonna start using Git/GitHub in my future projects.
I'm also interested in getting involved in TechKnights. Seems like a fun way to expand my knowledge programming and other interested subjects.
It's also nice to see likeminded individuals.
