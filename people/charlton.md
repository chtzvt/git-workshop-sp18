Hi! I'm Charlton Trezevant

I'm a CS major who's very involved in both [HackUCF](https://hackucf.org) and [TechKnights](https://techknights.org), and this is my second semester at UCF. I'm very glad to meet you all!

If you'd like a copy of the slide deck, as well as a collection of very useful links, head over [here](https://blog.ctis.me/git-workshop-f3ae056ac1e2) for supplementary materials.

If you have any questions, need help, or want to learn more, feel free to [message me on slack](https://hackersofucf.slack.com/messages/D6WKF4A48/) (I'm `@charlton`) or reach out [via email](https://www.ctis.me).

I hope you enjoy this workshop, and that the content is helpful and improves your life. Thanks for coming!

Andrew was here!
